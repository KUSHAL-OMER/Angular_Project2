<p>There is no limit of imaginations and observations. All the things arround us are having something unique in it. But these unique things are so simple that they provide no interest. But if we use our wisdom and imagination together then these things are realy much interesting than their ordinary look. Imagination is something that comes in our mind for doing something creative, but knowledge is something that can bring the imagination in the real life.</p>
<p>Let us assume that a persone is sitting in an ordinary park and looking towards an empty bench. While other people are bussy in themselves. Then he starts writing some thing on a page, the words that he has written describes his imagination. Those words may composed a story, poem or a composition that is going on in his mind. Well his written piece is just the words that has come in his mind at that time. Now let's see the part of knowledge here, while moving to his home he comes accross a director or a magzine publisher who is searching for a script or an article for his film or magzine. Now that person sold his content to that searching person. On next day he found his written piece in a magzine or found a film having on his written story. On finding these things he feels proud. This thing shows that if both knowledge and imagination combines then they can change the life of every persone.</p>
<p>Writing stories, poems or compositions are importent to change the world as many people get the idea to feel their surroundings and to improve the present for making better future. All these things also provide knowledge as they use facts to put their the matter. So keep on writing these things and if there is none who can bring these things in front of the world then there will no knowledge and entertainment in this world anymore. So we have provided the site to inhence the power imagination and knowledge.</p>
